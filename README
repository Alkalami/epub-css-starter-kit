Creating epubs that work in multiple readers can be painful, like debugging web problems back 
the glory days of ie6. Only this time there is no firebug.

If you find that it doesn't work on a particular reader, please file an issue containing the 
following items:

* Reader platform and version
* Sample html
* Sample css
* Expected result
