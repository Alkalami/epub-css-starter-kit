Epub CSS Starter Kit
========================

Creating epubs that work in multiple readers can be painful, like debugging web problems back 
in the glory days of ie6. Only this time there is no firebug.

Here's a css file to help alleviate the pain.

If you find that it doesn't work on a particular reader, please file an issue containing the 
following items:

* Reader platform and version
* Sample html
* Sample css
* Expected result

Some issues are ereader bugs. Some are css bugs. Ideally the css will look "good enough" on 
most devices. You can then take the css and tweak it for devices you want to focus on.
